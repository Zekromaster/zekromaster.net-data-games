# Completed games

A list of completed games. Most of the code in "processing/" was generated with
ChatGPT, and it's just used to generate a TOML file for putting the file into my
Hugo website.

Check data/ for a bunch of files, written in Italian in a consistent, standardized
format, detailing what games I've completed or plan on completing.
